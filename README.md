# About Me Description 

I believe that humans will always have the ability to rise above any situation, because life is what you make of it. We donâ€™t know what life is or why we are in this world; all we know, all we feel, is that we must protect it anyway we can.

Steve Jobs inspired me, when in his commencement address to Stanford University in 2005, he said "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma--which is living with the results of other people's thinking." I want to make mistakes, because that is how I learn; I want to follow the beat of my own drum even if it is "out of tune." The important thing is to live without regrets, so when my heart ceases to beat, it will make one last happy note and move on.
