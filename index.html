                <p>My chosen career is Software Engineer. Software Engineers create moderately complex 
                    software in C, C++, C#, Java, assembly language, or other selected languages for Garmin 
                    products and/or applications consistently following Garmin's coding standards and in 
                    accordance with applicable software development methodology and release processes. These 
                    software execute design for small sets of new functionality for a project.
                    A typical workday for a software engineer is usually improving on projects you've been working 
                    on and try to make them better and easier for people to us. An employee at Google will consult 
                    with his coworkers and read feedback on the products they help create. For instance, feedback 
                    on how easy the updated Google Chrome makes access email and the most viewed websites.
                    More experienced engineers serve as mentors to the newer engineers, teaching them the tips 
                    and tricks of making software. Engineers also have to perform as a technical leader for 
                    derivative software projects. Collaboration with other employees and engineers adds value 
                    through participation, providing comments and suggestions. This collaboration can help provide
                    solutions to a variety of problems using sound problem solving techniques.
                    Education and Qualifications
                    To become a software education, you would need at least a Bachelor of Science degree 
                    in Computer Science, Aerospace Engineering, Math or Physics, and a minimum of at least one 
                    year of relevant experience.
                    With this education, you should have the skills necessary to complete the required tasks 
                    accompanied with being a Software Engineer. The most common skills needed are: Working 
                    with Data and Information, Decision Making, Working with People, Achieving Results, Deadline 
                    Management, and Object life. I want to enjoy going to work and be happy to communicate with 
                    my bosses and coworkers. Although I don't have my heart set on this career, I feel like it would 
                    be a good fit for my life. I would enjoy making the products and services everyone uses easier to
                    understand and navigate through. In all honesty, I wouldn't see myself becoming a Software 
                    Engineer for too long. With the injuries I may sustain and the odds stacked against me in terms 
                    of promotion and the job itself, I don't think it would be a great fit for me in the long term.</p>

   <h2> Variable fonts </h2>
            <div> 
                <p>Variable font performance gains. OpenType variable fonts allow us to store multiple variations of a type family into a single font file. Monotype ran an experiment by combining 12 input fonts to generate eight weights, across three widths, across both the Italic and Roman styles.

                 <p>   One of the ways the new format preserves backward compatibility with other applications that don’t yet explicitly support variable fonts is something called ’named instances’—which are essentially mapped aliases for what used to be separate files. So whatever the typeface designer had in mind for ‘bold condensed’ would simply map to the appropriate points on the variation axes for weight and width. If the font has been made correctly, those instances will allow the font to be installed and used in recent versions of Windows and the macOS just like they always have been.</p>

                   <p> If the application fully supports variable fonts, then you would also be able to manipulate individual axes as you see fit. Currently, that includes recent versions of Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign, and also recent versions of the popular web/UI design application Sketch. </p>
                    
                  <p> Probably the most obvious axis is weight—since almost every typeface is designed with at least regular and bold weights, and quite often much lighter/thinner and bolder extremes. With a variable font, you can use the standard attribute of font-weight and supply a number somewhere between the minimum and maximum value defined for the font rather than just a keyword like normal or bold. According to the OpenType specification, 400 should equate to normal for any given font, but in practice, you’ll see that at the moment it can be quite varied by typeface. </p>
                    
                 <p>   This works by starting with a central or 'default' style, usually the 'Regular'–an upright roman design with the most typical weight and width that is most suitable for plain text. This is then connected to other styles in a continuous range, called an 'axis.' The most common axis is Weight, which can connect the default style through to a Bold style. Any individual style can be located along an axis and is called an 'instance' of the variable font. Some instances are named by the font developer, for example Weight axis location 600 is called SemiBold. </p>
                    
                  <p>  Italics #
                    The way that Italics are handled in variable fonts is interesting, as there are two different approaches. Typefaces like Helvetica or Roboto have interpolation compatible contours, so their Roman and Italic styles can be interpolated between and the Slant axis can be used to get from Roman to Italic. </p>
                    
                  <p>  Other typefaces (such as Garamond, Baskerville, or Bodoni) have Roman and Italic glyph contours that are not interpolation compatible. For example, the contours that typically define a Roman lowercase "n" do not match the contours used to define an Italic lowercase "n". Instead of interpolating one contour to the other, the Italic axis toggles from Roman to Italic contours. </p>
                
                <p>  INT: What design decisions do you have to make when creating a variable font?
                    
                    As with static fonts, no two-variable font projects are the same, so we start by defining the requirements. We consider the purpose, expression, accessibility, functionality, languages, and more. From there, we can confidently define a creative brief. With a variable font, this includes the style and characteristics, but also the design space and axes parameters (weight, width, optical size, italic, or slant).
                    
                    If a brief is fairly simple, for example, a display typeface that flexes to fit packaging sizes, we would consider the width axis. This would allow the typeface to stretch from its narrowest to its widest width and any width in between. With other briefs, another axis might be more appropriate. For example, if designing a single variable font to support both display and text sizes on the web, the optical size axis (which adjusts proportions, contrast, stroke weight, etc.) would be used. </p>
                    
                <p>    When designing a variable font family from the outset, the process is much simpler as you start with a single origin outline. It also provides a lot more opportunity, as you can design the font to make the most of the technology that’s available.
                    
                    We made Aktiv Grotesk variable because it’s pragmatic and rational with just a hint of warmth, a combination that’s hard to find in grotesque typefaces. We wanted to enhance its practicality with variable font, allowing designers to make the most of the font family’s huge range of weights, styles, and scripts in an economical way. On the web, for example, more weights and styles can be used in combination without impacting page load times. This is because the variable font format intelligently compresses the information needed to define a whole family into a single file, much smaller than the sum of the individual fonts.
                    
                    As our largest font family in terms of script support, Aktiv Grotesk (which you can try for free here) will be our first variable font supporting several world scripts. Initially, Aktiv Grotesk VF will support the Latin script, but we will soon be releasing a design update of the Arabic as a variable font with Thai, Cyrillic, Greek, and Hebrew scripts following throughout 2020. </p>

            <h2>Animated Scalable Vector Graphics</h2>

            <p>The web development sector is growing at a rapid pace, and SVG (scalable vector graphics) images are becoming more popular. As vector images, SVGs are composed of mathematical equations that define the positioning and color of lines and curves which make up graphic shapes and text in XML format. SVGs are used for icons, logos, graphic designs, and fonts.</p>
            <p>Using SVGs is an easy choice once you consider the advantages they offer. For a client, you get superb quality on any device. For us as developers, there are even more reasons to use SVG.</p>
            <p>Short for Scalable Vector Graphics, a vector graphics file format that enables two-dimensional images to be displayed in XML pages on the Web. Vector images are created through text-based commands formatted to comply with XML specifications. In contrast to JPEG and GIFimages on the Web, which is bitmapped and always remain a specified size, SVG images are scalable to the size of the viewing window and will adjust in size and resolution according to the window in which it is displayed. Benefits of SVG include smaller files size than regular bitmapped graphics such as GIF and JPEG files resolution independence so that the image can scale down or up to fit proportionally into any size display on any type of Web device text labels and descriptions that can be searched by search engines ability to link to parts of an image complex animation.</p>
            <p>It offers a vector description of graphics, thus you draw a triangle by specifying the location of its points, the width of the path, etc. Then you can infinitely zoom such objects. SVG is the only vector graphic format widely supported by today’s web browsers.</p>
            <p>VG is defined in pure standards-based XML, which is human-readable, and extensible to allow for metadata that can let you automate the objects you create with it. This lets you create precise vector objects in intuitive ways, as opposed to binary formats like Flash which required proprietary plugins and proprietary authoring tools. Because it is XML it can be generated and manipulated programmatically, which makes it natural for use cases such as data-generated graphics.</p>
            <p>SVG plays nicely with other web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript, and enjoys support in all major web browsers, across billions of devices. Because SVG lets you send vectors across the Internet (though it is also possible to include raster imagery in SVG), you can use SVG to minimize the data sent to the web client, without any degradation of image quality.</p>
            <p>A large number of small parts makes the use of the SVG format irrational. The more parts an image consists of, the heavier it grows in size. For example, here are two SVG maps of the United States. The second one is slightly more detailed than the first one. But the higher level of detail cost almost a fivefold increase in file size – 33 KB compared to 147 KB. If this map was not monochromatic, the increase would be much greater.</p>
